**Project Review**

Throughout the development of Legendary Motorsports, I focused on creating a seamless and engaging platform for car enthusiasts. In this review, I’ll showcase key aspects of the project, including real-world feedback, core features, and major accomplishments.

Night at the Museum Feedback – I received valuable insights from users testing the platform, with positive reactions to the UI and suggestions for mobile optimizations.

Project Feature Showcase – A deep dive into the comment system, highlighting how it enhances user interaction with real-time updates and a clean, responsive design.

Key Accomplishments – Covering the home page development, comment system integration, profile page design, settings page, and final frontend-backend integration to complete the interactive experience.

This review reflects both the strengths and areas for improvement as I look ahead to refining and expanding the project.


OVERALL this project has been an amazing experience and truly taught me so many aspects of life with hands on experience. First I was stressed when I needed to code, now I enjoy it.
