    <h1>Welcome to Jackson Hensley's Coding Blog</h1>
    <p>This blog highlights my projects and insights related to Python and JavaScript Lists and Arrays, focusing on Unit 3 of the AP CSP curriculum. During Sprint 2, I completed Lesson 3.10, where I explored the functionality of Lists and Arrays. This blog documents my hands-on experience with these essential data structures, showcasing their ability to manage and manipulate data efficiently.</p>
    <p>In this lesson, I practiced basic operations like appending and removing items, as well as more complex tasks like iterating over large data sets. By utilizing loops to process Lists and Arrays, I applied my knowledge to practical examples, preparing myself for classroom presentations and future projects. Through these exercises, Iâ€™ve gained confidence in handling structured data, a skill thatâ€™s critical for both the CB exam and Project-Based Learning.</p>
    <p>This blog captures not only my progress but also my reflections on how this work prepares me for both the technical and analytical challenges in programming ðŸ’».</p>

      <h2>Lesson 3.10: Lists and Arrays</h2>
      <p>Hereâ€™s a closer look at what I covered in Lesson 3.10 on Lists and Arrays:</p>

      <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lists and Arrays:</strong> I learned about their ability to store multiple items in a single variable, which simplifies data management. Lists can hold different data types, while Arrays are used for elements of the same type.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Operations:</strong> I practiced adding, removing, and accessing items, gaining experience with zero-based indexing and data manipulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Looping Through Data:</strong> I used loops to iterate over Lists and Arrays, efficiently processing each element and preparing for practical applications in data analysis and programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Applications:</strong> I explored real-world use cases, such as storing user input or organizing data in mini-projects, enhancing my understanding of data handling.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Code Snippets</h3>
      <p>Here are a few example code snippets that highlight what I learned:</p>

      <pre><code>
// Python: Working with Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "cherry", "date"]

// JavaScript: Array Loop
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let total = 0;
for (let num of numbers) {
  total += num;
}
console.log("Total:", total);  // Output: Total: 15
      </code></pre>

      <h3>Reflections and Future Goals</h3>
      <p>This lesson gave me a solid foundation in handling structured data. By working with Lists and Arrays, I feel more equipped to tackle future challenges, from classroom presentations to the AP CSP exam. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to applying these skills in more advanced projects, exploring how these data structures integrate with other programming concepts to create dynamic applications.</p>
