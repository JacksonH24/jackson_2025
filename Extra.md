        <h1>Going Beyond: My CSP Experience</h1>
        
        <p>Throughout this trimester, I have pushed myself beyond just coding and completing my own project. I made it a priority to <strong>collaborate, assist others, and refine my problem-solving abilities</strong> in ways that extended past the classroom.</p>

        <h2>Helping Others & Team Collaboration</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest aspects of my CSP journey was helping <strong>not just my own group, but multiple groups across the class</strong>. I spent significant time outside of class <strong>working through debugging issues, structuring Kanban boards, and reviewing designs</strong> to improve workflow.</p>

        <h3>Notable Contributions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spent <strong>over 5 study sessions at Panera</strong> helping different CSP groups with their projects.</li>
            <li>Personally assisted <strong>Jackson Patrick, Carson Sutherland, Rowan Sutherland, Aarush Shah, and Brandon Smurlo</strong> with various challenges in their projects.</li>
            <li>Traveled to the <strong>Sutherland household</strong>, dedicating <strong>multiple hours</strong> to troubleshooting a critical issue in their website.</li>
            <li>Created <strong>Kanban boards and whiteboard planning sessions</strong> for my group to ensure tasks were efficiently managed.</li>
            <li>Developed <strong>detailed issue tracking systems</strong> to help streamline our project’s development process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflections on Strengths & Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>This class pushed me to recognize my <strong>strengths and areas for growth</strong> as both a developer and a teammate.</p>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leadership & Collaboration:</strong> I naturally took on a leadership role, helping others while ensuring my own work met high standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Whether it was debugging an API, integrating a frontend feature, or fixing someone else’s broken code, I was always up for the challenge.</li>
            <li><strong>Organization & Planning:</strong> I made sure our team was never lost by setting up structured <strong>Kanban boards, issue tracking, and team whiteboard sessions</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weaknesses & Areas for Growth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Sometimes I spent too much time helping others and had to rush parts of my own project.</li>
            <li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> I found myself over-refining features when I could have moved on more efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Delegation:</strong> I occasionally took on too much work myself instead of trusting others to handle tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Forward: My Future in Computer Science</h2>
        <p>My experience in CSP has solidified my interest in Computer Science and software development. I plan to continue building on these skills in future courses, college, and beyond.</p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Taking <strong>AP Computer Science A</strong> to deepen my understanding of Java and object-oriented programming.</li>
            <li>Exploring <strong>internship opportunities</strong> in software development to gain real-world experience.</li>
            <li>Continuing to <strong>develop full-stack applications</strong>, refining both my frontend and backend expertise.</li>
            <li>Expanding my <strong>knowledge in AI and machine learning</strong>, as I am interested in how these technologies shape the future.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This trimester has been <strong>one of the most rewarding experiences</strong> in my high school career. Not only did I push my technical skills, but I also learned <strong>the value of collaboration, problem-solving, and leadership</strong>. Helping others succeed while refining my own abilities was something I truly enjoyed, and it’s an approach I plan to take with me into future projects and my career.</p>
